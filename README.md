### 👨‍💻 Operator Profile
I am a self-taught Cybersecurity Blue Team Trainee on a mission to reach the top floor of defensive security operations. I don't just use tools; I build them to understand the underlying architecture of attacks.

- 🔭 I’m currently building **Flow**, a custom SIEM implementation.
- 🎯 I focus on **Network Defense, Malware Analysis, and Intrusion Detection**.
- 🧠 My approach: Learning by engineering solutions to real-world threats.

### 🚀 Featured Project: FLOW
**Flow** is my own version of a SIEM (Security Information and Event Management) tool designed to detect advanced network threats and analyze file integrity.

| Detection Modules 🚨 | Forensics & Analysis 🔍 |
| :--- | :--- |
| **MITM Attacks:** Real-time interception detection. | **File Integrity:** SHA-256 Hashing. |
| **Reverse Shells:** Detects standard and **Tunneling** variants. | **Malware Hunting:** **Fuzzy Hashing** for identifying polymorphic threats. |
| **Brute Force:** Pattern recognition for failed auth spikes. | **Database:** Comparative hash analysis against known signatures. |
